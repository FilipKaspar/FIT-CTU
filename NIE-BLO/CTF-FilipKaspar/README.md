## Storyline
In the year 2084, MegaCorp has constructed an unparalleled mass surveillance system, granting them absolute dominion over Neo Tokyo. Their automated Sentinel force is poised for deployment, yet a critical vulnerability lies within their initialization sequence - the system must be fully activated before it can be dismantled from within.
Your mission:
1. Infiltrate the Network Beacons - MegaCorp's hubris has left backdoors in their security nodes.
2. Seize control of the Twin Towers:
   - The ancient Beacon Tower, the guardian of the city's digital heartbeat.
   - The impenetrable Proxy Tower, MegaCorp's pride and firewall.
3. Power the Grid - But tread carefully! The Fusion Battery craves a precise fuel cell configuration. One misstep, and the entire operation could fail.
5. Corrupt the Sentinels - These AI enforcers are MegaCorp's crowning achievement, yet every masterpiece has its flaw. Manipulate their own surveillance protocols against them.
6. Trigger the Collapse - With the Sentinels compromised and the system in disarray, deliver the final blow that will liberate Neo Tokyo from MegaCorp's digital shackles.

*Remember: Sometimes to destroy the machine, you must first make it run.*

## Goals
Gain as much MegaCorp tokens as possible (approx. 35000).

## Rules
In general, behave as if all contracts were already in production. This means:
  - do not alter the existing contracts;
  - do not utilize any accounts you should not have access to (i.e. `megacorp_owner`). Only initiate transactions from the `hackeer` account, or any other new accounts you create;
  - you are free to deploy any contracts of your own.

## Setup
- Install [Wake](https://ackee.xyz/wake/docs/latest/)
- Run `wake up`
- Write exploit in `tests/test_default.py`
- Run `wake test`
